# Alpaca Sheep Guards Simulation

This project simulates the viability of using alpacas to protect sheep flocks on farms. The simulation evaluates the costs, animal losses, and predator impacts in various Australian states. It aims to provide farmers with insights on whether alpacas are a cost-effective solution for protecting sheep from predators.

## Features
- Simulates three protection strategies: No protection, Single alpaca protection, and Pair of alpacas protection.
- Calculates total costs including alpaca maintenance and the loss of sheep and lambs to predators.
- Tracks animal losses by predator type, including foxes, dingos, feral pigs, and wedge-tailed eagles.
- Outputs a detailed report of average costs, losses, and kills by each predator.

## Technologies Used
- **Java** for programming the simulation logic.
- **Random** class for generating random factors like predator attacks and alpaca maintenance costs.
- **File I/O** for reading predator data and writing simulation results.

## Installation
